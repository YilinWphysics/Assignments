###############Question 1################## 
The numerical method with the relaxation technique takes 9078 number of iterations to converge. 
The line charge density lambda on the ring is 0.0. 
The numerical and analytical method yield similar results. But it should be bear in mind that the analytical method should be taken 
with a grain of salt as the grid box is square and the source is circular, therefore the boundary condition of 0 cannot be properly met. ###############Question 2################## 
The numerical method with the analytical technique takes 68 number of iterations to converge. 
It is obvious that the conjugate gradient method is much faster than the relaxation method in Q1 - 
 this new method takes a lot fewer steps to reach the same convergence criterion.
 ###############Question 3################## 
A total steps of 142 is taken to reach the same convergence criterion. 

 ###############Question 4################## 
A total steps of 142 is taken to reach the same convergence criterion. 
There should be disturbance in the field after the addition of the bump, 10 percent of the wire diameter. 
However, the disturbance is not that obvious just by a quick observation with the naked eyes.

 ###############Question 5################## 
Using the 1D Neumann for heat transfer, the heat curves are plotted shown in the saved figure for Q5. 
There are indeed constants that need to be set. 
In order to make the solution converge properly, it must be that k * dt / (dx**2) <= 0.5 
For this calculation, these values are chosen as dt=0.001, dx=0.001, and k=0.00025 to satisfy the aforementioned inequality.
