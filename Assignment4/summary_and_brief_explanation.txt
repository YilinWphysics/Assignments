(a) 
A gaussian model was used to filter the noise. The start and end of the strain must be 0 to enable proper fft, hence a cosine window was used (however, any other function that allows start and end being 0 will do). The result plots are saved in .png formats.

(b) 
Result plots are shown in .png formats. 

(c)
The signal-to-noise ratio of (SNR) individual detectors in Livingston and in Hanford, as well as the combined L+H, are shown in .png formats. 

(d) 
The results approximately line up but not at the exact same time value (sec), and the peak is not perfectly symmetrical. A proposed reason is that the noise might not be perfect Gaussian stationary noise. 

(e) 
Results are printed in separate text file. 

(f)
Results are printed in separate text file. 
The fitting method was that of a Gaussian, with the specifics of sigma=0.0005 (arbitrary value). The total error was calculated by difference in time ("delta_time" in code) * c (speed of light in vacuum) / distance (arbitrarily assigned as 1e6 m).
