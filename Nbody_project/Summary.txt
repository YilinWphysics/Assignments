################### Question 1 ##################### 
As shown in the animation, the particle behaviour is stationary. 

################### Question 2 ##################### 
It can be observed from the git that the two masses remain in orbit around each other. 

################### Question 3 ##################### 
As shown from the two txt files into which the energy (E) values are saved, energy is conserved for the periodic and the non-periodic condition, as for each file the energy remains the same in all iterations. 
Please ignore that fact that for each iteration, the energy is saved into an array. This is because in the function.py the mass that used to be a float was defined as an array in __init__ when the function mass_early_uni was defined. 

Please refer to the periodic and non-periodic gifs for animation of the 2e5 masses' evolution with time. 

################### Question 4 ##################### 
Please refer to the periodic gif for animation of the 2e5 masses' evolution with time.
It can be observed that the masses cluster to some specific locations, due to initial higher density.
